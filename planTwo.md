Bible Study Learning Platform - Comprehensive Plan
This is an excellent project! I can see from the slide example how rich and detailed these lessons are. Let's create a platform that honors the depth of this content while making it accessible and engaging for students.
Platform Vision
A bilingual (English/French) learning management system specifically designed for rich, PowerPoint-style Bible study lessons with robust quiz and assessment features.

Core Features

Multiple content blocks per slide: text, images, Bible verses, vocabulary definitions, callouts
Template library (title slides, content slides, quiz slides, comparison slides)
Reusable content blocks (save formatted sections for reuse)
Bulk import from existing PowerPoint files (we'll parse and convert them)
Preview mode that shows exactly what students will see
Bilingual content support (toggle between EN/FR on same lesson)

Technical Architecture
Tech Stack Recommendation
Frontend:

React + TypeScript
Tailwind CSS for styling
Tiptap or Slate.js for rich text editing
React DnD for drag-and-drop
React Query for data fetching

Backend:

Node.js + Express or NestJS
PostgreSQL for structured data
S3 or similar for media storage
Redis for caching

Authentication:

JWT-based auth with role management (Teacher/Student)

Deployment:

Docker containers
CI/CD with GitHub Actions
Vercel/Netlify (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend)


PowerPoint Import Strategy
Since your teacher has years of existing PowerPoints, we should:

Build a PowerPoint parser that extracts:

Text content with formatting
Images and their positions
Slide layouts
Notes/comments


Create an import wizard that:

Shows preview of converted slides
Allows adjustments before final import
Maps PowerPoint elements to our content blocks


Support iterative improvements (he can refine imported lessons)


Development Phases
Phase 1: MVP (Core Platform)

Teacher can create lessons from scratch
Students can view lessons and take quizzes
Basic authentication and course management
Mobile-responsive interface

Phase 2: PowerPoint Integration

Import wizard for existing PowerPoints
Advanced slide templates
Rich content blocks (callouts, highlighted verses, vocabulary cards)

Phase 3: Enhanced Learning

Progress tracking and certificates
Analytics dashboard
Study tools (glossary, bookmarks)
Discussion features

Phase 4: Scale & Polish

Performance optimization
Advanced bilingual features
Offline mode
Mobile apps (React Native)


Sub-Agent Prompts Structure
I'll create specialized prompts for each agent role to manage different aspects of development through Claude CLI:
1. Architect Agent
Focuses on: System design, database schema, API structure, technology decisions, scalability planning
2. Design Agent
Focuses on: UI/UX design, component library, design system, accessibility, responsive layouts
3. Code Review Agent
Focuses on: Code quality, best practices, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, type safety
4. Testing Agent
Focuses on: Test coverage, unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests, test data generation
5. CI/CD Agent
Focuses on: Build pipeline, deployment automation, environment configuration, monitoring setup
